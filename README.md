## Overview

This project is built using Playwright and TypeScript. It is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for automating end-to-end UI testing for web applications, REST APIs ans SOAP call/requests. The framework includes features for test execution, reporting, and code quality enforcement, ensuring high-quality test automation.

## Key Features/Functionalities/Capabilities

![image](./framework_features.jpg)

This framework is designed to accelerate the development and execution of UI tests, REST APIs ans SOAP call/requests, ensuring high test coverage and reliability for web applications.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Typescript
- Playwright
- Allure Report
- Monocart Report

## Prerequisite Software and Tools

- Node 20.X
- install java/jdk for Allure Report (Set JAVA_HOME)
- VS Code, or equivalent IDE
- Git

## Get Started

### Packages installations

```bash
npm i
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode
`npm test` – run Playwright tests

# Run all tests in headed mode
`npm run test:headed`

# Run tests for specific environment (local, qa, staging)
# Examples:
# PLAYWRIGHT_ENV=qa npm test
# PLAYWRIGHT_ENV=staging npm test
```

## Validating Syntax and Linting Rules

It is recommended to run Linting and syntax validation scripts locally before pushing changes to your branch in order to prevent broken code, or code that does not meet basic coding standards, making it into your remote branch.

📝 Syntax, and linting errors, must be fixed before a feature branch is allowed to be merged with the main branch, i.e. `main`.

### Syntax Validation

```bash
# Runs the syntax/type check
`npm run check`
```

### Run Linting Rules

```bash
# Runs the linting validations rule
`npm run lint`
```
